Hashing the Load Balancer gives advantage is caching the memorey of client, it acts as an indiviual mapping of the same clients to specified servers
Consistent hashing is useful when the is cache memory is important in the servers 
In most of the cases the servers are placed in circular(cycle) way in clockwise  connecting all the servers  
Need to have optimiziers while having an failure of servers
Main Compoents of hashing is Hash Key , Hash Function, Nodes(Targets)
