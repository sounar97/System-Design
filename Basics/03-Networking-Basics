Networking is medium of tranfer of data or requests from one point to another point
-Each server  of ipv4 have 32bit address and ipv6 have 128bit address max value would be 256
  Internet have set rulescalled Internet Protocols
  Data transferred in internet is called Packet, it includes a header file called MetaData where information regarding the data is stored, like postal address details 
  TCP protocol helps in splitting the data into mutilple packets in clinet and recieve in the same order in the server , the packet alsoinvolves the tcp heade files in metadata
  Server needs to be in public area for it to recieve the requests from the client 
  The server recieves the request in the https(440) port but it doesnt really sends back the response to the same port in the clinet side
