cpu reads faster from cache memory 
cache control in header helps in minimising the loading, reading from disk is faster than reading from the network 
cache HIT which gets stored locally ,MISS which check if its still avaiable or missed 
write-around cache which deals with only primary disk from server 
write-through cache which writes first to cache memory and then to disk(primary)
write-back cache which only deals with cache memory 
Eviction Policy where the memeory is full while requesting the data from the servers decides which part of memory to let go in memeory , which follows FIFO methods
Alternatively we can LRU AND LFU methods
