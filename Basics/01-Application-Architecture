-The Procedureinvlove how an developer deploys the code to server,and where server is directly or indirectly dependent on Storage,whereas server acts 
as an computer(handling operation as an main guy)
-The User whereas requests the things from server,while it depends on how many requests are coming in and how the server is handling, to impove server we use 
 vertical scaling or horizontal scaling process
-Load Balancer acts as an request handling agent,where it disturbute the requests acoording to traffic
-Server may interact with mutiple servers externally according to needs
-Logging will store logs of server(eg:output statemnets of programs)
-Metrics reads and writes the info on how the server and resources of server are handling and working,it also helps in creating timeseries data with logging
-Alertz(alerting machine)which alarms the developers with help of matrics data, if any threshold is bypassed
